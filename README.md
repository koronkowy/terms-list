terms-list
========

I was super tired of my 320+ page, 64k word document for learning. It was hard to keep track of terms and if I repeated them and hard to access mobile. So I threw them into a little gh page.
Now terms-list has a search bar that searches the terms (not the definitions) and links to other projects in my ecosystem of little GitHub pages.

How To Submit
===============

Honestly, there's no need to submit to this because it's my list from my notes. But feel free to fork & copy this / stylize it how you want if this kind of thing is a useful little tool for you to have hosted in gh.

Future
===============

Kinda want to turn this into a little flash-card utility to study terms. Maybe some kind of classification that would tag/track terms in some way.
