    { term: 'SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)', description: 'SAE is a secure key exchange protocol used in WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) to protect wireless networks from offline dictionary attacks and ensure a more secure authentication process. Unlike the Pre-SharedKey (PSK) method used in WPA2, which is vulnerable to certain types of attacks, SAE provides a more secure handshake process by using a password-based key exchange mechanism that is resistant to brute-force attacks. SAE works by ensuring that both the client and the access point derive the same cryptographic key independently, without transmitting the key itself over the air. This process makes it much harder for attackers to capture and crack the network’s security credentials.' },
    { term: 'Offline Dictionary Attack', description: 'An offline dictionary attack is a type of cyberattack in which an attacker attempts to crack a password or passphrase by systematically comparing encrypted password hashes against a precomputed list of possible passwords, known as a "dictionary." The attack is called "offline" because it does not require continuous interaction with the target system; instead, the attacker works with captured data (like password hashes) in their own environment. Offline dictionary attacks are effective against weak or commonly used passwords and can be performed relatively quickly if the password is simple or present in the dictionary.' },

    { term: 'Technical Security Controls', description: 'Sometimes called logical security controls. Technical security controls involve the use of technology to secure systems and data. Executed by computer systems (instead of people): These controls are automated and enforced by technology, such as firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption, rather than relying on human intervention. Implemented with technology: Technical security controls are specifically implemented using technological tools and software to protect digital assets and information. Examples: Encryption: Technical security control that protects data by converting it into a coded format, ensuring that only authorized parties can access it. IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems): Technical security control that monitors network or system activities for malicious behavior or policy violations. Firewalls: Technical security control that monitors and controls network traffic, acting as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.' },
